# quack-tests-static
Tests of Quack static semantics.  Testbench created by Zayd Hammoudeh.
Contributions of test cases by Cristian Ramirez and Kristi Belcher. 

These test cases should be *syntactically* correct (pass the parser). 
Those whose names begin with "bad" should fail a static semantics test, 
including rules for naming, well-formed class hierarchy, variable 
initialization, and type rules.
